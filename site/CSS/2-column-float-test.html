            “A friend once told me that the real message Bram Stoker sought to convey in 'Dracula' 
            is that a human being needs to live hundreds and hundreds of years to get all his reading 
            done; that Count Dracula, basically nothing more than a misunderstood bookworm, was draining 
            blood from the necks of 10,000 hapless virgins not because he was the apotheosis of pure evil 
            but because it was the only way he could live long enough to polish off his extensive reading 
            list. But I have no way of knowing if this is true, as I have not yet found time to read 
            'Dracula.”

            “Every article and review and book that I have ever published has constituted an appeal to the 
            person or persons to whom I should have talked before I dared to write it. I never launch any 
            little essay without the hope—and the fear, because the encounter may also be embarrassing—that 
            I shall draw a letter that begins, 'Dear Mr. Hitchens, it seems that you are unaware that…' It 
            is in this sense that authorship is collaborative with 'the reader.' And there's no help for 
            it: you only find out what you ought to have known by pretending to know at least some of it 
            already.

            It doesn't matter how obscure or arcane or esoteric your place of publication may be: some sweet law 
            ensures that the person who should be scrutinizing your work eventually does do so.”
            ― Christopher Hitchens, Hitch 22: A Memoir
