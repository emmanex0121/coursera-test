            in the straits, ships sail on in grey smoke: some with decks empty, some with 
            men checking ropes, and one with a milling crowd taking their last glimpses. 
            Each passing bow wave, rolling over a grey sea flecked with white, sighs on 
            pebbles ,stretched out to muddy patches of harsh grass held back by a rock wall. 
            Overhead, a seagull screeches, falling behind me towards the wooden framed house, 
            where a lit window beckons in the early morning gloom.

            Five ships have drawn by and away since I rose to sit in the cold wind and remember a 
            child not of mine, but one I loved. As always too soon he becomes a man, losing all 
            innocence except hope. On birthday mornings. I would wake him with a tray made of 
            sea-shore wood piled with a plate of scrambled eggs and the tea in a cracked bull mug. 
            On a full moon, laughing together, it would be thrown high over the beach into the sea. 
            In the mornings, alone on the shore, I would search for another year or to learn if the 
            sea called. When he stirred, I would straighten the eiderdown and then sit on the nearby 
            bench, moving aside his clothes. Sitting up, he would smile and reach for the tray.

            He always ate quickly before slowly sipping his tea, in silence. When ready we talked 
            according to the mood of the sea: slow some days, others with stories taller then a 
            mast. All the time I ignored the paintings and drawings; some of sailors weeping, 
            others of ships, some with oars, some with sails, breaking apart in wild waves, and 
            others of women like bleached bones on the beach looking out to sea. Some were by him 
            but most were by the others who had rested here. Once they told my future but it was my 
            past that betrayed. A husband dead, a sister dust - both mere words - when once one a 
            chesty laugh and the smell of wood smoke and the other a giggle over secrets and gossip. 
            And I had no child to comfort me. I prayed to the Gods, bled the Bull, and threw doves 
            to the wind. Then on the day of storms, the sea gave me a son, his skin water soft and 
            his breath of mist. I asked not the price. Then when my skin grew to wood bark, my teeth 
            fall as autumn seeds and breasts became bloated baskets, the sea came for me. And my 
            grandchildren found only the sea-spray of a hot summerâ€™s day.

            Since then, many have seen my eyes and felt my embrace and learnt that no lamp window 
            waits. Yet I keep some safe for women wearing the water of a child. Those children find 
            me. At last the sun breaks away clouds and the light in my window dims. The cup with 
            bull fresh and bold is taken out of my coat and I throw it up and over muddy grass and 
            the sighing pebbles. It soars over the sea that is turning blue and falls towards the 
            distant ships ready for its return.

            'Take of the earth its fruits only if sown with the sweat of your labours,' said the 
            LORD. This was so said Kings and the lowly said Amen. Till truth fell Kings to sweat in 
            fields. And then it came to pass that Bankers said this was so and the lowly said Amen.
